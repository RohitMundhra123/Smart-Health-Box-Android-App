Smart Health Box is a project that I developed as an Android app using Android Studio. It is an innovative approach to healthcare technology that allows users to monitor their health and detect the early signs of heart disease. The app collects data from the user, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and other vital signs. The collected data is then analyzed using a custom machine learning model hosted as an API. The model interprets the data to determine whether the user has a heart disease or not.

This project has significant importance in the field of healthcare as early detection of heart disease can prevent the occurrence of a major cardiac event. The Smart Health Box app is easy to use and provides users with a convenient way to monitor their health. The project required a diverse skillset, including Android app development, machine learning, and API integration.

I am proud to have developed the Smart Health Box project and believe it would be an excellent addition to my portfolio. The project showcases my ability to develop innovative solutions to real-world problems using the latest technologies. The Smart Health Box project is an excellent example of my ability to develop an end-to-end solution, from app development to machine learning, which would be valuable to demonstrate my capabilities to potential employers or clients.<br><br>
